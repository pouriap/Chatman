# Chatman
A 2-Peer Chat Application

Chatman was created when I was obsessed with Batman. It's Chat+Batman.

Chatman is a 2-peer chat application. It means it scans the network and connects to the first instance of Chatman that it finds.

Chatman can send text messages and files. Drag-n-drop files to the input text to send them.

Chatman has many backgrounds you can choose from. Your username will be derived from the background name because it's fun.

Chatman can also turn off the other PC it's connected to. It's useful sometimes.

Chatman Rises is a new update of Chatman that makes it useable by people who are not me.

## Running Chatman
To run Chatman you need JAVA Runtime Environment (JRE) 8+

It is recommended to use the installer provided in the release section. (You have to install JAVA separately).

Chatman's default language is Persian(Farsi). To change to English go to your installation directory, 
open `config.conf` and change `locale=fa_IR` to `locale=en_US`. If `config.conf` doesn't exist run Chatman once and it will be created.

## License 
Chatman is free. I know nothing about licenses, but I've used some open source libraries in it. 
I've also used some images off duckduckgo I hope that's fine. ðŸ’œðŸ’œðŸ’œ
