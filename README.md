# Chatman Facts
Chatman was created for my personal use and is not intended for public use.

Chatman is a 2-peer chat application. It scans the network and connects to the first instance of Chatman that it finds.

Chatman can send text messages and files. Drag-n-drop files to the input text to send them.

Chatman has themes you can choose from which decide what kind of notification the connected peer will get when you send them a message.

## Running Chatman
To run Chatman you need Java Runtime Environment (JRE) 8

Use the installer provided in the release section to install Chatman. (You have to install Java separately).
